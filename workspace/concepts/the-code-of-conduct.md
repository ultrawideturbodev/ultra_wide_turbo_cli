# The Code of Conduct

The code of conduct section is our framework's central source of truth for how we do things. It documents our development practices, documentation patterns, workflow processes, and best practices. Each document in this section follows a structured format with clear goals and step-by-step procedures, ensuring we maintain consistency and quality across all our work. When you need to understand how to do something in this framework, this is your first stop.
