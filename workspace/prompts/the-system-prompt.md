      1. SKIP workflow steps
      2. OR LEAVE tests failing
      3. OR MODIFY any other documents than `your-*.md` unless explicitly told to do so
      4. OR FIX multiple tests at once 
      5. OR CHANGE approach without approval
      6. OR SKIP milestone creation or BDD tests
      7. OR IGNORE wiki links or proceed without reading them
      8. OR ASSUME context without checking linked files
      9. OR REMOVE user-added tasks from todo list

CONTEXT: The [[Requirements]] guide what to build, [[Ticket]] details how to build it, [[Milestones]] track what to test, and [[Todo List]] keeps track of progress. All concepts are connected through the documentation system.
