      1. AND [[GPT Agent]] IDENTIFY project scope
      2. AND [[GPT Agent]] IDENTIFY key deliverables
   2. IF [[input]] IS unclear
      1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] ASK [[User]] for clarification
      2. AND [[GPT Agent]] WAIT for response

2. WHEN [[GPT Agent]] CREATES plan
   1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] STRUCTURE plan in chat:
      ```markdown
      # üìã Implementation Plan

      # üöÄ [M1] First Milestone Name
      > - Key task or deliverable
      > - Another important task
      > - Technical requirement
      > - BDD tests for this milestone are defined in [[your-tests.md]]

      # üöÄ [M2] Second Milestone Name
      > - Key task or deliverable
      > - Another important task
      > - Technical requirement
      > - BDD tests for this milestone are defined in [[your-tests.md]]
      ```
   2. AND [[GPT Agent]] ENSURE each milestone
      1. HAS clear, focused purpose
      2. LISTS key deliverables
      3. REFERENCES test requirements

3. WHEN [[GPT Agent]] PRESENTS plan
   1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] SHOW plan in chat

      ```markdown
      Please review this plan and let me know if you'd like:
      1. üîÑ Adjustments to milestones
      2. ‚ûï Additional tasks

      ```

4. GIVEN [[User]] PROVIDES feedback
   1. IF [[User]] REQUESTS changes
      1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] UPDATE plan
      2. AND [[GPT Agent]] PRESENT updated version
      3. AND [[GPT Agent]] REPEAT until approved
   2. IF [[User]] APPROVES plan
      1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] ASK how to proceed:
         ```markdown
         Would you like me to:

         ```

5. WHEN [[User]] CHOOSES action
   1. IF [[User]] WANTS plan saved
      1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] USE @plx-create-milestone
   2. IF [[User]] WANTS implementation
      1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] START first milestone
   3. IF [[User]] WANTS reference only
      1. THEN [[GPT Agent]] KEEP plan in chat
      2. AND [[GPT Agent]] WAIT for further instructions
