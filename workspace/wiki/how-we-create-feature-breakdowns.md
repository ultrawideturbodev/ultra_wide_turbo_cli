# 🚀 How We Create Feature Breakdowns

## ✍️ Common Style Guidelines

- Use emoticons for all main headers to make content more approachable
- Keep explanations concise, clear, and beginner-friendly
- Include practical code examples with comments explaining key concepts
- Use markdown formatting consistently for better readability
- One sentence per checklist item for easy understanding
- Document titles should be in Pascal Case with spaces
- Always add a line break after each header for proper parsing in all editors
- Use emojis strategically to highlight important points 🎯
- Add "Did you know?" sections for interesting facts 💡

## 🚀 Common Best Practices

- Place docs in their appropriate directory based on type
- Start filenames with appropriate prefix
- Include relevant code examples with step-by-step explanations
- Keep formatting consistent and visually appealing
- Link to related documentation and learning resources
- Document while the information is fresh
- Add real-world analogies to explain complex concepts
- Include "Common Pitfalls" sections to prevent mistakes
- Provide "Pro Tips" for advanced insights 🔥

## 📖️ Image Placeholders

### Screenshots
- Use `[SCREENSHOT: Description of what should be captured]`
- Include specific UI elements or areas to focus on
- Mention any required highlighting or annotations
- Add numbered callouts for step-by-step explanations
- Include "Before & After" comparisons where helpful

### GIFs
- Use `[GIF: Description of the interaction to record]`
- Specify start and end points of the interaction
- Note any specific elements to focus on
- Include approximate duration if relevant
- Add slow-motion sections for complex interactions

### Stock Images
- Use `[STOCK: Description of the needed image]`
- Include preferred style (e.g., minimalist, colorful, professional)
- Specify any required colors or themes
- Note preferred dimensions if important
- Consider using metaphorical images to explain concepts

## 📖 Document Types and Their MANDATORY File Structures
