# ðŸŽ¯ Turbo Clone Command Milestones

## M1: Command Layer Implementation
```gherkin
Feature: Clone Command Registration
  As a developer
  I want to register the clone command
  So that users can access it through the CLI

  Scenario: Register clone command
    Given the CLI is initialized
    When I add the clone command type
    Then it should be registered in TurboCommandType
    And it should have proper help text
    And it should accept a tag parameter

  Scenario: Validate tag parameter
    Given the clone command is registered
    When I run "turbo clone" without a tag
    Then it should show an error message
    And it should display the command usage

  Scenario: Show help text
    Given the clone command is registered
    When I run "turbo clone --help"
    Then it should show the command description
    And it should show usage examples
    And it should list available options
```

## M2: Tag Validation
```gherkin
Feature: Tag Validation
  As a developer
  I want to validate the provided tag
  So that I only process valid tags

  Scenario: Validate existing tag
    Given I have a tag "test-tag" in storage
    When I run "turbo clone test-tag"
    Then it should find the tag in storage
    And it should proceed with source lookup

  Scenario: Handle non-existent tag
    Given I have no tag "missing-tag" in storage
    When I run "turbo clone missing-tag"
    Then it should show an error message
    And it should exit with non-zero status

  Scenario: Validate tag format
    Given I have an invalid tag "!invalid!"
    When I run "turbo clone !invalid!"
    Then it should show a format error message
    And it should suggest valid format
```

## M3: Source Lookup
```gherkin
Feature: Source Directory Lookup
  As a developer
  I want to find all source directories for a tag
  So that I can copy their contents

  Scenario: Find tag sources
    Given I have a tag with sources
    When I look up the sources
    Then it should return all source paths
    And it should validate they exist

  Scenario: Handle no sources
    Given I have a tag without sources
    When I look up the sources
    Then it should show "no sources" message
    And it should exit gracefully

  Scenario: Validate source access
    Given I have sources with mixed permissions
    When I validate source access
    Then it should identify inaccessible sources
    And it should report access issues
```

## M4: File Copy
```gherkin
Feature: File Copy Operation
  As a developer
  I want to copy files from sources
  So that they are replicated in target directory

  Scenario: Copy source files
    Given I have valid source directories
    When I copy the files
    Then they should be in target directory
    And should maintain directory structure
    And should show progress bar

  Scenario: Handle copy errors
    Given I have problematic source files
    When I attempt to copy them
    Then it should collect error details
    And should continue with remaining files
    And should show error summary

  Scenario: Handle existing files
    Given target has existing files
    When I copy without --force
    Then it should skip existing files
    And should report skipped files
    
  Scenario: Force overwrite
    Given target has existing files
    When I copy with --force
    Then it should overwrite existing files
    And should report overwritten files
```

## Dependencies
- dart:io for file operations
- mason_logger for progress reporting
- LocalStorageService for tag lookup
- TurboCommand for CLI integration

## Technical Details
- File copy uses recursive directory traversal
- Progress bar updates per file
- Error collection in CopyResult objects
- Summary generation in CopySummary
