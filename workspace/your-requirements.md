    - [ ] Scenario: Register new tag target command
        - GIVEN the CLI application is running
        - WHEN the system initializes commands
        - THEN the "tag target" command is registered under "tag"
        - AND it accepts a tag parameter
        - AND it shows in help text

    - [ ] Scenario: Validate tag parameter
        - GIVEN the user runs "turbo tag target"

    - [ ] Scenario: Validate existing tag
        - GIVEN the user runs "turbo tag target <existing-tag>"

        - THEN it finds the tag
        - AND proceeds with target linking

    - [ ] Scenario: Create new tag
        - GIVEN the user runs "turbo tag target <new-tag>"
        - WHEN the system checks local storage
        - AND doesn't find the tag

        - GIVEN the command has a valid tag
        - WHEN the system checks the current directory
        - AND the directory is not registered as a target
        - THEN it creates a new TurboTargetDto
        - AND stores it in local storage

    - [ ] Scenario: Use existing target
        - GIVEN the command has a valid tag
        - WHEN the system checks the current directory

        - AND stores it in local storage

    - [ ] Scenario: Handle existing relation
        - GIVEN valid tag and target exist
        - WHEN the system checks for an existing relation
        - AND a relation already exists

    - [ ] Scenario: Handle invalid directory
        - GIVEN the user runs the command
        - WHEN the system checks the current directory
        - THEN it shows an error message

    - [ ] Scenario: Show operation success
        - GIVEN the user runs the command
        - WHEN the system completes all operations
        - THEN it shows a success message

---

None - we can mirror the source command implementation exactly.
